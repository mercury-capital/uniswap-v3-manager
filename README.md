# Uniswap V3 Position Manager

A script to actively manage your Uniswap V3 Positions. Provide it a "range" percentage and a pool, and it will
create a position with that range in that pool. If the price moves your position out of range, it will withdraw
your position and create a new one based around the new current price.

## Installation

### Build from source

#### Prerequisites

```js
$ yarn install
```

## Configuration

The application is configured through CLI parameters:

```
Options:
  -r, --rpc <url>           RPC URL to fetch data from the blockchain (default: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<PROJECT_ID>")
  -w, --width <percent>     Price width of LP positions in percentage terms (default: "2")
  -b, --buffer <eth>        Ether buffer to keep on wallet for fees (default: "2")
  -o, --outFile <fileName>  File to write position history in (default: "./history.json")
  -k, --key <key>           Private key hex string (default: "")
  -kf, --keyFile <file>     Private key file (default: "")
  -e, --encrypted           Whether or not the private key file is encrypted (default: false)
  -es, --scheme <scheme>    Encryption scheme for the encrypted private key file (choices: "gpg", default: "gpg")
  -h, --help                display help for command
```

Options can also be provided through environment variables:

#### Required configuration parameters

`RPC_URL`

The URL at which the application can talk to the blockchain through JSON RPC. Infura, or a fullnode instance work here.

`PRIVATE_KEY`

Hex encoded string private key for the wallet to manage positions with.

Alternatively private key can be provided through an encrypted key file. GPG is the only encryption scheme supported currently.

#### Optional configuration parameters

`PRICE_WIDTH`

The percentage of the current price from which to set the range boundaries on either side.
For example, if `PRICE_WIDTH` is 5 and the current price is 1000, the lower boundary will be set to 5% below current price
or 950, and the upper boundary will be set to 5% above current price, or 1050 - rounded to the nearest tick.
Default: 3

`BUFFER_ETHER`

Your wallet needs some ETH to pay for gas of transactions. This configuration sets the amount of ETH to leave on your wallet
after creating a position as a buffer for gas.
Default: 2

`HISTORY_FILE`

The app stores a json history of all position changes. This configuration tells it which file to place this history in.
Default: ./history.json

`UNISWAP_PAIR`

The uniswapv3 pool configuration. This is encoded as `<token0address>:<token1address>:<fee>`
Default: 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2:0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48:3000 (USDC:WETH 3%)

## Usage

```sh
‚ùØ yarn start
    Address: 0x22cb6...b1453937d
    ********* Position *********
    range: 2150 - 2350
    Current Price 2275
    In Range: true
    Position total value USDC: 2275
    Position total value WETH: 1
    Position liquidity USDC 1100
    Position liquidity WETH 0.5

# Arbitrum fork

To work in a local fork of Arbitrum:
1. Make the fork using the mainnet chain id and with mining on an interval, e.g. for hardhat node set in `hardhat.config.ts`:
```typescript
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.19",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
        chainId: 42161,
        forking: {
            url: "https://arbitrum-mainnet.infura.io/v3/....",
            blockNumber: 137658629,
        },
        mining: {
            auto: false,
            interval: 10000
        }      
    }
  }  
};
```

2. Make sure you have from the first token in the pair, e.g. for USDC-WETH you need USDC:
```sh
cast call 0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
cast call 0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831 "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xB38e8c17e38363aF6EbdCb3dAE12e0243582891D
cast rpc hardhat_impersonateAccount 0xB38e8c17e38363aF6EbdCb3dAE12e0243582891D
cast send 0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831 --unlocked --from 0xB38e8c17e38363aF6EbdCb3dAE12e0243582891D "transfer(address,uint256)(bool)" 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 5000000000
```
Note: Using Uniswap to swap ETH for USDC manually with Metamask works for current fork but not for a fork in the past (likely because the price was different). Deploying liquidity manually in the fork doesn't work.

3. Start the manager:
```sh
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545/ PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 BUFFER_ETHER=9990 UNISWAP_PAIR=0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831:0x82aF49447D8a07e3bd95BD0d56f35241523fBab1:3000 yarn start
```
